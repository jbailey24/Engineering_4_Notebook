## CAD_Swing_Arm 

### Assignment Description

This assignment asked me to replicate a swing arm part from a set of drawings. The assignment style is similar to a portion of the Onshape Associate Certification test.

### Reflection
Creating this part from a drawing was fun! I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of it. 

## Skateboard

### Assignment Description 
The goal of this assignment was to follow an Onshape skateboard tutorial.

### Reflection
The tutorial was obviously made for someone who had never touched CAD before, and so it was a little frustratingly slow, but it did remind me of what all of the Onshape shortcuts are, which was helpful. I also had never used (or heard of) the Replicate tool before. I'm not sure exactly when I would use it in the future, but it sure saved a lot of time on this assignment!


## Lego_Brick

### Assignment Description 
The bulk of this assignment was just following another Onshape tutorial. In part 1, I built a 2 by 4 lego brick; in part 2, I learned how to configure the brick to be different sizes, shapes, and colors; in part 3, I created an assembly of a lego duck; and in part 4 I created a drawing of the duck assembly. After I completed the base assignment, I figured out how to create slanted (bevelled) lego bricks and added many more colors. I then used the new pieces and colors to help create a lego watermelon slice.

### Reflection
The main part of this assignment went very smoothly. Mostly, I learned about how to format drawings with exploded views and bills of materials. I  ran into a slight hiccup when I had interferences between the bricks in the duck assembly, but it turns out I just misread a dimention, and it was an easy fix. The hard part came in when I tried to make the slanted bricks. It's a bit messy, but to keep the shell but cut off the tubes for the slanted bricks, I have to have the same remove extrude at two points in the part. I also had some problems figuring out what angle to have the slant at. I tried and tried to solve it mathmatically, but I must have kept on making a mistake somewhere because my dimentions always had interferences. In the end, I just found a dimention that worked through trial and error (2.3mm!). Also, because you can't linear pattern the studs 0 times, I couldn't find a way to get the 1 by 1 slant brick to work, so I had to create a new part just for 1 by 1 and 2 by 1 slanted bricks that didn't include studs at all. Finding the offical lego colors was also a bit of pain. I couldn't find the exact values online, so I had to find a photo of the colors instead and put it into a drawing program to get the rgb values. Once I had all of that sorted out, it wasn't too difficult to build the watermelon off of a photo I found online and then create a drawing of it.
