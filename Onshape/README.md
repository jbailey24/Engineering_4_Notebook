## CAD_Swing_Arm 

### Assignment Description

This assignment asked me to replicate a swing arm part from a set of drawings. The assignment style is similar to a portion of the Onshape Associate Certification test.

### Reflection
The tutorial was obviously made for someone who had never touched CAD before, and so it was a little frustratingly slow, but it did remind me of what all of the Onshape shortcuts are, which was helpful. I also had never used (or heard of) the Replicate tool before. I'm not sure exactly when I would use it in the future, but it sure saved a lot of time on this assignment!
