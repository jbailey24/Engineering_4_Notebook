imp = input("Type in your text, then press enter: ").split()       # 'split()' converts input into array of individual words

for i in imp:               # outer for loop calls each individual word
    i = i + ("-")           # adds '-' on the end of every word
    for a in i:             # inner for loop calls each charater in word 'i'
        print(a)
