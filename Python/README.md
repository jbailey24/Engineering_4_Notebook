## Python_Dice_Roller


### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was definitely helpful because I haven't coded in Python in several months. Nesting the options menu took me a few tries to get right and I was wonderfully reawkened to the world of input().

### Reflection





Takes two user-inputed numbers and finds their sum, difference, product, quotient, modulo, and both their factorials.

This was a good memory jog on how to format functions and definitely reminded me to watch my strings vs integers.
