## Python_Dice_Roller


### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was definitely helpful because I haven't coded in Python in several months. Nesting the options menu took me a few tries to get right and I was wonderfully reawkened to the world of input().

## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that takes two user-inputed numbers and finds their sum, difference, product, quotient, modulo, and both their factorials.

### Reflection

This was a good memory jog on how to format functions and definitely reminded me to watch my strings vs integers.

## Quadratic Solver

### Assignment Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that takes a user inputed quadratic equation and returns the equation, the real roots, and the equation in vertex form. If the equation doesn't have real roots, the program just returns the equation.

### Reflection

I was able to reuse a good bit of code from the previous assignments, but figuring out how to call the real roots or not outside of the function was tricky. Also I had mostly forgotten how to find the vertex form of a quadratic equation, so writing somewhat concise code for that took a few iterations. I initially found some code online for finding the highest common demominator, but after struggling for a while to get it to work, I discovered that there is a hcf function in the python math library (which, don't get me wrong, was nice, but why couldn't I have dicovered that earlier!).
